                    <h1>Rearing your Own Termites and Harvesting them to Feed Your Chickens!</h1>
                    Growing termites or providing conditions so you can collect them is an old way of feeding chicken in traditional African society but which we must revive to provide our chicken with a very rich source of protein like no other. Any farmer who can ensure a continuous supply of termites or ants to his flock ends up with very healthy and happy chicken. You might have seen termites under rotting trees long abandoned, among pieces of decaying clothes, traditional pots or any bio-degradable matter. </P>

Poultry farming is the practice of raising domesticated birds, such as chickens, ducks, turkeys, and geese, for various purposes, including meat, eggs, and feathers. It is a widespread and important agricultural activity worldwide.
