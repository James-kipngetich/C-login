<h1>Be aware:</h1>
 When chickens 
lay eggs, the mother hen can actually make noises that chicks still incubating inside of their eggs can hear 
and respond to. The chicks even make tiny “peeps” back from inside of their eggs! Once grown, chickens utilize
 a wide range of sounds to communicate with each other.

        <p>Welcome to our Poultry Website! We are passionate about poultry and dedicated to

        <h1>CHICKEN CARE <BR>!</h1>
            The toughest phase in raising your kienyeji chickens is during the chick brooding. 
            This is the period when they are most delicate and where mistakes can be quite costly. Many farmers 
            prefer to start raising the chicks on their own right from the first day when the chicks are one day old. 
            It is generally cheaper to acquire chicks at this stage so you can build a fairly large flock within a very short 
            period of time. However, the chick brooding stage
             requires special as well as intensive care in order to boost the survivability of the chicks.
